# goweb

My backend web application using golang using #postgresql

Install postgresql and start it listening on port 5434

Install golang using <a href="https://golang.org/dl/">link</a> to download and also instructions to install on different platforms

Run go get on folder path and wait for all required imports to be installed for linux run /usr/local/go/bin/./go get or /usr/bin/go/bin/./go get

Using postgresql import setup.sql at sql path

Run go build to build files and run the file make sure postgre is up

Open browser and listen on port 8080

For now it has the ability to register and users and login, to implement tokens, chatroom and also a customized forum using websockets
